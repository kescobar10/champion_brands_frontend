                                <p class="brand-place">San Francisco, CA</p>
                                <p>CoAround the turn of the 20th century, in the year 1900, there were thousands of small breweries operating across America. When Freccia and O&rsquo;Sullivan were researching old San Francisco breweries (trying to find a cool name for their new brewery), what really made an impact was the discovery that there were about 40 breweries operating just within the city limits of San Francisco (by comparison, today there are eight with a population more than double what it was in 1900). They realized that the brewery captured the essence of the neighborhoods of San Francisco. They were the local gathering places. Places to exchange ideas, debate politics and philosophy. Places for families to come together on weekends. Places that provided something unique—hand crafted beer that was different at every brewery and that defined the taste of a neighborhood.</p>

                                <p class="brand-place">Brooklyn, NY</p>
                                <p>Founded in 1988, Brooklyn Brewery is made of a diverse cast of characters from around the world – who have all committed to creating great beers, tasty food and inspirational experiences for their community. With a portfolio that includes either perennials and six seasonals (not to mention numerous reserves and big bottles), Brooklyn Brewery&rsquo;s flagship creation is the classic American Amber Lager – Brooklyn Lager. Styled after the Vienna lagers popular in Brooklyn in the late 1800s, the amber-gold Brooklyn Lager embodies the classic balancing act between the caramel malt center, the refreshing bitterness and the floral aroma. However, Brooklyn uses another centuries-old technique – dry-hopping – to make it their own.</p>

                                <p>With a history that dates back to 1847, Carlsberg&rsquo;s flagship beer was first brewed in 1904 by the son of the brewery&rsquo;s founder. The introduction of the pilsner coincided with the icon Art Nouveau logo that has remained relatively untouched ever since. Slightly sweet with an herbal hop presence, Carlsberg finished with moderately bitter refreshment. Carlsberg also produces the Special Brew and the Elephant Beer.</p>
